# All-Girl Hack Night site #

We need to put together a website! Why? Because we're a bunch of developers and we should totally have an awesome website. You can contribute anything you want. Some ideas..

+ specs or requirements in the form of issues or whatever works for you
+ design mockups
+ HTML
+ entire sub-systems (please try to keep these at least on technologies that'll run on the same server)
+ bug fixes
+ content (however it makes sense)
+ ??? (your ideas here - you can edit this document, too!)
